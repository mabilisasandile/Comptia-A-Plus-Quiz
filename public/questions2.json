    "question": "1. A technician needs to provide remote support for a legacy Linux-based operating system from their Windows laptop. The solution needs to allow the technician to see what the user is doing and provide the ability to interact with the user's session. Which of the following remote access technologies would support the use case?",
    "answers": [

        "correct": false
      }
    ],
    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "VNC is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It is platform-independent and widely supported on Linux, which makes it ideal for providing interactive remote support for a Linux-based operating system. It allows the technician not only to view the remote desktop session but also to control it, fulfilling the need to see and interact with the user's session."

    "question": "2. A technician is attempting to join a workstation to a domain but is receiving an error message stating the domain cannot be found. However, the technician is able to ping the server and access the internet. Given the following information: \n IP Address - 192.168.1.210 \n Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0 \n Gateway - 192.168.1.1 \n DNS1 - 8.8.8.8 \n DNS2 - 1.1.1.1 \n\n Server - 192.168.1.10 \n.\nWhich of the following should the technician do to fix the issue?",

        "correct": false
      }

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "Domain join failures with successful IP connectivity almost always point to name-resolution issues. The workstation is using public DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1), which have no records for the internal AD domain or its controllers. Pointing DNS at the internal DNS server (192.168.1.10) ensures the domain name and SRV records can be resolved, allowing the join to succeed."

    "multiple": false,
    "explanation": "In a structured change-management process, the very first step is to propose (or formally request) the change via a Request for Change (RFC). This ensures stakeholders review the need, assess risks, and determine the priority before any approvals, scheduling, or implementation occur."

    "explanation": "An \"OS Not Found\" error most commonly indicates the system isn't booting from the correct device.
