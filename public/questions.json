SMTP is an essential protocol for email traffic.\nPort 110 (POP3 - Post Office Protocol v3):\nPOP3 is used for retrieving emails from a mail server. It is commonly used for downloading email messages to a local client, after which the messages are deleted from the server. While not as commonly used today (due to IMAP being preferred), POP3 is still a recognized email protocol, and its association with port 110 makes it a valid answer."
